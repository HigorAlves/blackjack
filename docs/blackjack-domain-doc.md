# ðŸ‚¡ Blackjack Game Domain

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Implement a Blackjack game using Next.js and TypeScript, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture. This document defines the core domain, bounded contexts, entities, and game rules that will drive the design and implementation.

---

## ðŸ§  Game Rules (Ubiquitous Language)

- The goal is to have a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over.
- Players are dealt two cards initially.
- The player can choose to **Hit** (draw a card) or **Stand** (end turn).
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.
- Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.
- Aces can be worth 11 points, but if that causes a bust, they count as 1.
- The dealer reveals one card and draws until their total is **17 or higher**.
- If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose.
- If the dealer busts and the player doesnâ€™t, the player wins.
- If neither busts, the hand with the highest score wins.
- Ties are a draw.

## ðŸ§± Domain Model

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Card {
        +Suit: string
        +Value: string
        +getPoints(): number
    }

    class Deck {
        -cards: Card[]
        +shuffle(): void
        +draw(): Card
    }

    class Hand {
        -cards: Card[]
        +addCard(card: Card): void
        +getTotal(): number
        +isBust(): boolean
        +hasBlackjack(): boolean
    }

    class Player {
        +hand: Hand
        +isStanding: boolean
        +hit(card: Card): void
        +stand(): void
    }

    class Dealer {
        +hand: Hand
        +play(deck: Deck): void
    }

    class Game {
        +player: Player
        +dealer: Dealer
        +deck: Deck
        +start(): void
        +playerHit(): void
        +playerStand(): void
        +evaluateWinner(): string
    }

    Card --> Deck
    Deck --> Game
    Hand --> Player
    Hand --> Dealer
    Player --> Game
    Dealer --> Game
```

## ðŸ§­ Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

### ðŸ’¡ Core Domain
The core domain is the **Game** logic, including rules for scoring, busting, standing, and determining a winner.

### ðŸ“¦ Bounded Contexts
- **GameContext**: Handles gameplay, game state, and turn logic.
- **DeckContext**: Manages deck generation and card draws.
- **UIContext (Adapter)**: Interacts with user actions (start, hit, stand).

## ðŸ§© Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

```mermaid

    subgraph Application Core
        GameService
        Player
        Dealer
        Hand
        Card
        Deck
    end

    subgraph Primary Ports
        UI --> GameService
    end

    subgraph Secondary Ports
        GameService --> UIRenderer
    end

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The player can start a new game.
- [ ] The player can hit to draw cards.
- [ ] The player can stand to end their turn.
- [ ] The dealer plays automatically after the player stands.
- [ ] The game announces a winner (Player, Dealer, or Draw).
- [ ] All game logic follows Blackjack rules precisely.

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

- Use dependency injection to decouple services.
- The domain layer must be completely framework-agnostic.
- Testing will focus primarily on domain logic with unit tests.
